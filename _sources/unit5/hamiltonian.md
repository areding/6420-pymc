# Hamiltonian Monte Carlo

This is not part of the course, but I want to include it because PyMC and Stan both rely on it.

If you want a really good explanation of HMC, try [A Conceptual Introduction to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.02434.pdf) by Michael Betancourt. This actually includes a great introduction to general MCMC methods and the motivation for using them, so it's worth reading the first two sections even if you don't go further into HMC.
