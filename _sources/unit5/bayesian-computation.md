# Bayesian computation

Once we move past conjugate cases, while we may have the posterior in analytical form as a result of Bayes' theorem, it won't be any recognizable distribution no matter how much we manipulate it. Many of the normalizing constants have no closed-form solution. As the professor shows in lessons 2 and 4 of this unit, we can try to approximate them numerically, but this may be imprecise or computationally intractable (with time complexity increasing exponentially with the number of parameters, as in the example from section 2.1 [of this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.00670.pdf).
