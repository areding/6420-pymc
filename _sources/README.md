# A redo of ISYE 6420 code into Python

Using PyMC, pgmpy, NumPy, and other libraries to redo ISYE 6420: Bayesian Statistics at Georgia Tech in Python. The original course
used Octave and OpenBUGS, and students have been requesting something more modern for years.

Professor Vidakovic released his code under [CC BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/), so I guess this is the same. Is that license meant for code?

Original course code is all [here](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/isye6420/supporting.html).
