# Bayes' theorem

$P(A|B)=\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$

Your main takeaways from this unit should be Bayes' theorem and how to use it in conjunction with other basic concepts in probability (you may find the law of total probability especially helpful for the homework).

Bayes' networks are fun - I recommend trying to code them by hand first if you're having trouble understanding them. After that, pgmpy helps with the more complicated networks.
