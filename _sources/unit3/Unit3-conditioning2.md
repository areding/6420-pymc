# Conditioning, Part 2

## The law of total probability

This is a really important formula:

$$P(A) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} P(A \mid H_i) P(H_i)$$

We use this often in homework problems for finding the marginal probability of some event ($P(A)$). You will want to partition your sample space into mutually exclusive, exhaustive hypotheses ($H_i$). Try it out on some of the [supplementary exercises](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/isye6420/supporting.html)!

## Lecture errata

- There's a mistake at 5:40: $0.94\times 0.3 + 0.95\times 0.5 + 0.97\times 0.2$ equals $0.951$, not $0.957$.
