# History of Bayesian Statistics

These two lectures talk a little bit about Thomas Bayes and the history of Bayesian statistics. They're not very in-depth. It might be worth adding something about the key figures and philosophies of the field to this page at some point, to give more background to concepts like subjectivism versus objectivism, Empirical Bayes, etc. that the professor touches on later. 

In the meantime, I recommend reading [this page](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/statistics/) on the philosophy of statistics from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Knowing this stuff is not strictly required but I find it helpful to put the various ideas and how they relate in context. Especially useful are Sections 2 and 4, which discuss the differences between epistemic and physical interpretations of probability and Bayesian statistics.
