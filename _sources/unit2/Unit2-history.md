# 2.1$--$2: History of Bayesian statistics

These two lectures talk a little bit about Thomas Bayes and the history of Bayesian statistics. They're not very in-depth - it might be worth adding something about the key figures and philosophies of the field to this page at some point, to give context to concepts like subjectivism vs objectivism, Empirical Bayes, etc. that the professor touches on later. In the meantime, I recommend reading [this page](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/statistics/) on the philosophy of statistics from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Knowing this stuff is not required but I find it helpful.

## Historic overview links

Here are links to the book and essay the professor references:

- [Wikipedia page for *The Doctrine of Chances*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doctrine_of_Chances) by Abraham de Moivre. Includes links to the original text.

- [An Essay Towards Solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances (abridged version)](https://www.ias.ac.in/article/fulltext/reso/008/04/0080-0088) by Thomas Bayes.
