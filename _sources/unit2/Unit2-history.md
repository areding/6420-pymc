# History of Bayesian Statistics

These two lectures talk a little bit about Thomas Bayes and the history of Bayesian statistics.

If you'd like to learn more about where Bayesian statistics fits in with classical, I have a couple of links for you to check out. First, [Bayesian Methods: General Background](https://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/general.background.pdf) takes you from Herodotus to current problems (current in 1996, anyways) over 16 pages.

Second, check out [this page](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/statistics/) on the philosophy of statistics from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Knowing this stuff is not at all required but I find it helpful to put the various ideas and how they relate in context. Especially useful are Sections 2 and 4, which discuss the differences between epistemic and physical interpretations of probability and Bayesian statistics.
