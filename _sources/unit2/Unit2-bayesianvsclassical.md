# Bayesian vs. Frequentist

Throughout the course, you'll hear Professor Vidakovic use both "classical" and "frequentist" as catch-all terms for "not Bayesian." Greg Ganderburger has a [great series of posts](https://gandenberger.org/2014/07/28/intro-to-statistical-methods-2/) on the differences between frequentist, likelihoodist, and Bayesian methods. I'm linking to the second post in the series for the great Venn diagram at the top, but I recommend the entire thing if you're interested.


This Stack Exchange post, "[What's the difference between a confidence interval and a credible interval?](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/2272/whats-the-difference-between-a-confidence-interval-and-a-credible-interval)", also has some really good discussion about the topic. We will talk more about confidence intervals versus credible intervals in Unit 4.
