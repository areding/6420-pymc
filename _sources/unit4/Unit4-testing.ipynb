    "First, I recommend checking out 3blue1brown's [video on Bayes' factor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG4VkPoG3ko) to help with intuition. There is a similar example in Professor Vidakov's [statistics book](https://statbook.gatech.edu): {cite:t}`vidakovic2017engineering` page 103. Unlike the classical approach, Bayesian testing doesn't prioritize the null hypothesis. Instead, we calculate the posterior probabilities for both hypotheses, then choose the one with the larger posterior probability.\n"

So if your prior is just a continuous distribution, the probability at any given point is 0. At a high level, if your prior doesn't contain your hypothesis, you are essentially ruling out the hypothesis before you even build the rest of your model. Without mixing in the point mass, you've already predetermined that your hypothesis is impossible.\n",
