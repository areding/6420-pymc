    "## Joint Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "A joint distribution describes the behavior of two or more random variables simultaneously. If $X = (X_1, X_2, ..., X_n)$ is a vector of random variables, then the joint probability density function (PDF) $f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$ gives the likelihood that $X_1$ takes the value $x_1$, $X_2$ takes the value $x_2$, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The joint cumulative distribution function (CDF) $F(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$ gives the probability that each of $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$ is less than or equal to $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "For two dimensions, i.e., when $X = (X_1, X_2)$, we write these as:\n",

    "- Joint CDF: $F(x_1, x_2)$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conditional Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "A conditional distribution describes the behavior of one or more random variables given the values of some other variables. If we want to know the distribution of $X_1$ given the value of $X_2$, written $f(x_1 | x_2)$, its defined as the ratio of the joint distribution to the marginal distribution of $X_2$. The marginal distribution, $f(x_2)$, is obtained by integrating the joint distribution over all values of $X_1$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x_1|x_2) = \\frac{f(x_1, x_2)}{f(x_2)}, \\quad \\text{where} \\quad f(x_2) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x_1, x_2) dx_1$$"
