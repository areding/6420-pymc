# About this course and website

The course was originally developed at Georgia Tech in 2004 by Professor Brani Vidakovic, who is now the head of the [Texas A&M Department of Statistics](https://science.tamu.edu/news/2020/07/branislav-vidakovic-named-head-of-texas-am-statistics/). Many of the individual examples are related to biostatistics (Prof. Vidakovic wrote the textbook [*Engineering Biostatistics*](https://statbook.gatech.edu/index.html)), but the methods are broadly applicable.

:::

This site mostly follows the original [course outline](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/isye6420/plan.html). Each example lists the corresponding lecture video and contains a download link to the original code file(s). Only the lecture video where the professor goes over the example code will be listed, but there may be other relevant lectures that you'll need to watch. Any necessary data will either have a download link or, if the data is compact enough, will be included in the code.

This is a supplement to the Canvas site, not a replacement!

## Other recommended resources

These are not required for the class, but they might be helpful. Prof. Vidakovic's lectures often assume that the student has a certain amount of background knowledge, so if you feel lost or if you just want to dive deeper into the subject check them out.

### Textbooks and courses

*Statistical Rethinking* by Richard McElreath is a great book for gaining intuition about Bayesian inference and modeling in general.

- [lecture videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcUM9US4XdMROZ57-OIRtIK0aOynbgZN)
- [PyMC3 code examples](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc-resources/tree/main/Rethinking_2). These should be easy to adapt to PyMC v4.

*Bayesian Data Analysis* by Gelman, Carlin, Stern, Dunson, Vehtari, and Rubin goes into more mathematical theory than *Statistical Rethinking*. I use it as a reference - not planning to try reading this one all the way through!

### Blogs

- Andrew Gelman, author of *Bayesian Data Analysis* (above), has a blog: [Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/).
- [Dan Simpson](https://dpsimpson.github.io/), one of the maintainers of the [Stan PPL](https://mc-stan.org/), has a blog called [Un gar√ßon pas comme les autres (Bayes)](https://dansblog.netlify.app/) with opinionated and funny deep dives into various Bayesian topics. Warning: NSFW language.
- [Count Bayesie: Probably a probability blog](https://www.countbayesie.com/) by Will Kurt.
- Michael Betancourt, another Stan developer, has a [series of incredibly in-depth](https://betanalpha.github.io/writing/) posts and notebooks on Bayesian modeling.
- PyMC developer [Austin Rochford's blog](https://austinrochford.com/posts.html) has a lot of good posts.
- Another PyMC developer, [Oriol Abril](https://oriolabrilpla.cat/blog/), posts some really helpful PyMC examples.

### Podcasts

- [Learn Bayes Stats](https://learnbayesstats.com/) by Alex Andorra, one of the PyMC developers.

### Other

- I don't use Stan at all, but I still reference the [Stan User's Guide](https://mc-stan.org/docs/2_29/stan-users-guide/index.html) often.
