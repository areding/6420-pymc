    "A team of students in Quantitative Engineering Physiology  Lab (BMED 3610) at GaTech wants to see the effect of Daidzein and Genistein, two isoflavones from soybeans, and time period cultured has on the Alkaline Phosphatase Activity (ALP) of osteoblastic cells. An increase in ALP activity would indicate these immature bone cells are differentiating and moving towards matrix maturation. The team cultures 3 identical well plates with wells of control, cells with Daidzein treatment, and cells with Genistein treatment in each. The ALP was measured on day 2 for well plate 1, day 6 for well plate 2, and day 10 for well plate 3. Drug was coded as 1 for Control, 2 for Daidzein, and 3 for Genistein. Days 2,6, and 10 are coded by 1,2, and 3 respectively. ALP Activity was multiplied by a factor of  10^6. \n",
