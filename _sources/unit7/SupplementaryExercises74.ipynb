    "## 6. Shocks!\n",
    "An experiment was conducted to assess the effect of small electrical currents on farm animals, with the eventual goal of understanding the effects of high-voltage powerlines on livestock. The experiment was carried out with seven cows, and six shock intensities, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 milliamps (shocks on the order of 15 milliamps are painful for many humans). Each cow was given 30 shocks, five at each intensity, in random order. The entire experiment was then repeated, so each cow received a total of 60 shocks. For each shock the response, mouth movement, was either present or absent. The data as quoted give the total number of responses, out of 70 trials, at each shock level. We ignore cow differences and differences between blocks (experiments).\n",
