# Introduction

This repository contains Python translations of the examples from Georgia Tech's online version of [ISYE 6420: Bayesian Statistics](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/isye6420/), created by Professor Brani Vidakovic and currently taught by Professor Roshan Joseph. I plan to redo most OpenBUGS examples in [PyMC3](https://docs.pymc.io/), except for Bayesian network problems, which will use [pgmpy](https://pgmpy.org/). There's also some miscellaneous MATLAB code that I'll redo in base Python or NumPy.

I'd like to make it easy for students to use PyMC instead of OpenBUGS to finish the course. This will take a while because of my other commitments, but hopefully students taking the class in Spring 2022 will be able to get some use out of it. 

PyMC often has more than one way to do the same thing because it's under active development. I'm also learning as I go, so these solutions will not be perfect! Please feel free to contribute if you have a better way to code something. You can file an issue on Github, make a post on the class forums, email me, or submit a pull request.

I'll start out by redoing the "Codes for Unit X" files on the [Supporting material page](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/isye6420/supporting.html). After that, I might tackle the optional exercises for each unit.
