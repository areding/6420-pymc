# Introduction

This repository contains Python translations of the examples from Georgia Tech's online version of [ISYE 6420: Bayesian Statistics](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/isye6420/), created by Professor Brani Vidakovic and currently taught by Professor Roshan Joseph. I plan to redo most BUGS examples in [PyMC3](https://docs.pymc.io/), except for Bayesian network problems, which will use [pgmpy](https://pgmpy.org/). There's also some miscellaneous MATLAB scripts that I'll translate.

I'd like to make it easy for students to use PyMC instead of BUGS to finish the course. This will take a while because of other commitments, but hopefully students taking the class in Spring 2022 will be able to get some use out of it.

PyMC often has more than one way to do the same thing, plus it's under active development. I'm also learning as I go, so these solutions will not be perfect! Please feel free to contribute if you have a better way to code something. You can file an issue on Github, make a post on the class forums, email me, or submit a pull request.

## Current status

Right now I'm working on redoing the "Codes for Unit X" files on the [Supporting material page](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/isye6420/supporting.html) with minimal changes.

## Future plans

- Add more explanations/notes.
- Update TOC/sidebar to make it easier to navigate.
- Add FAQs based on student questions.
- Add solutions to the optional exercises.
- Update all examples to PyMC 4.0.
- Add more explanation/content related to MCMC algorithms.
