    "The original lecture is about thinking of Bayesian models as [directed acyclic graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) (DAGs). The professor talks a little bit about why they're a useful way to think about the relationships between random variables, the Markovian property, and independence of nodes. I will add some more details here in the future, but it's low-priority for now.\n",
