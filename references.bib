A person using the method to quantify his/her opinions performs specified elicitation tasks. The hyperparameters of the conjugate distribution are estimated from the elicited values. The method is designed to require elicitation tasks that people can perform competently and introduces a type of task not previously reported. A property of the method is that the assessed variance matrices are certain to be positive definite. The method is sufficiently simple to implement with an interactive computer program on a microcomputer.},

 abstract = {Statistical issues in conducting randomized trials include the choice of a sample size, whether to stop a trial early and the appropriate analysis and interpretation of the trial results. At each of these stages, evidence external to the trial is useful, but generally such evidence is introduced in an unstructured and informal manner. We argue that a Bayesian approach allows a formal basis for using external evidence and in addition provides a rational way for dealing with issues such as the ethics of randomization, trials to show treatment equivalence, the monitoring of accumulating data and the prediction of the consequences of continuing a study. The motivation for using this methodology is practical rather than ideological.},

Most of the existing literature deals with modelling the number of goals scored by each team. In this paper, we work in a different direction. Instead of modelling the number of goals directly, we focus on the difference of the number of goals, i.e. the margin of victory. Modelling the differences instead of the scores themselves has some major advantages. Firstly, we eliminate correlation imposed by the fact that the two opponent teams compete each other, and secondly, we do not assume that the scored goals by each team are marginally Poisson distributed. Application of the Bayesian methodology for the Skellam's distribution using covariates is discussed. Illustrations using real data from the English Premiership for the season 2006–2007 are provided. The advantages of the proposed approach are also discussed.}",

 abstract = {Gibbs sampling has enormous potential for analysing complex data sets. However, routine use of Gibbs sampling has been hampered by the lack of general purpose software for its implementation. Until now all applications have involved writing one-off computer code in low or intermediate level languages such as C or Fortran. We describe some general purpose software that we are currently developing for implementing Gibbs sampling: BUGS (Bayesian inference using Gibbs sampling). The BUGS system comprises three components: first, a natural language for specifying complex models; second, an 'expert system' for deciding appropriate methods for obtaining samples required by the Gibbs sampler: third, a sampling module containing numerical routines to perform the sampling. $S$ objects are used for data input and output. BUGS is written in Modula-2 and runs under both DOS and UNIX.},

Suppose the intervals between events are modeled as iid exponential (λ i), or the counts as Poisson (λ iti), for the ith item. Furthermore, so as to represent between-item variability, each individual rate parameter λ i, is presumed drawn from a fixed (super) population with density gλ(·;θ), θ being a vector parameter: a parametric empirical Bayes (PEB) setup. For gλ, specified alternatively as long-Student t(n) or gamma, we exhibit the results of numerical procedures for estimating superpopulation parameters θ and for describing pooled estimates of the individual rates λ i, obtained via Bayes's formula. Three data sets are analyzed, and convenient explicit approximate formulas are furnished for λ i estimates. In the Student-t case, the individual estimates are seen to have a robust quality.},

abstract = {Abstract Interpretation of regression coefficients is sensitive to the scale of the inputs. One method often used to place input variables on a common scale is to divide each numeric variable by its standard deviation. Here we propose dividing each numeric variable by two times its standard deviation, so that the generic comparison is with inputs equal to the mean ±1 standard deviation. The resulting coefficients are then directly comparable for untransformed binary predictors. We have implemented the procedure as a function in R. We illustrate the method with two simple analyses that are typical of applied modeling: a linear regression of data from the National Election Study and a multilevel logistic regression of data on the prevalence of rodents in New York City apartments. We recommend our rescaling as a default option—an improvement upon the usual approach of including variables in whatever way they are coded in the data file—so that the magnitudes of coefficients can be directly compared as a matter of routine statistical practice.

abstract = {The log-rank test or the proportional hazard model is a valuable, widely accepted method for analyzing time-to-response data from comparative clinical trials. When the hazard ratio is constant in time, this procedure is optimal. Indiscriminate or unthinking use of this approach results in problems in the determination of treatment differences. For example, when the true survival curves intersect, the hazard ratio cannot be constant, i.e., the hazard functions are not proportional. It is shown that by considering time-by-treatment interactions we gain flexibility in describing the relationships among hazard functions. In this paper we demonstrate with the results of a clinical trial how available methodology can be used to permit tests for the appropriateness of the model and to enable infirmative analysis of such data.}
