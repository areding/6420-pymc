    "# Probabilistic Programming Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "## Graphical models\n",
    "\n",
    "The original lecture is about Bayesian models as graphical models. The professor talks a little bit about why they're a useful way to think about the relationships between random variables, the Markovian property, and independence of nodes. A related concept is [plate notation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_notation).\n",
    "\n",
    "He cites *Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective*, which is the old version of [*Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction*](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/) mentioned in the [other recommended resources](content:other_resources) section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with this unit, we will be using [Probabilistic Programming Languages](../unit1/Unit1-software.md) (PPLs) to run our models. Check out [Chapter 10 of *Bayesian Modeling and Computation in Python*](https://bayesiancomputationbook.com/markdown/chp_10.html) for a look at what goes into creating a PPL and the components involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Missing example\n",
    "\n",
    "In the original unit 6 code archive, there's a file called ```DeMere.odc``` that doesn't seem to have anything to do with the rest of the unit. You can find a Python implementation [here](https://areding.github.io/6420-pymc/original_examples/stuff/Unit3-DeMere.ipynb) (right-click and Save Link As...).\n",
    "\n",
    "## BUGS\n",
    "\n",
    "The course lecture examples use OpenBUGS from this point forward. I've mirrored the last version of OpenBUGS on this site:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Windows, [version 3.2.3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/areding/6420-pymc/main/BUGS/OpenBUGS323setup.zip)\n",
    "- Linux, [version 3.2.3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/areding/6420-pymc/main/BUGS/OpenBUGS-3.2.3.tar.gz)\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't recommend attempting to get BUGS working on a Mac. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you do want to use BUGS-style models, I recommend [NIMBLE](https://r-nimble.org/) or [MultiBUGS](https://www.multibugs.org/). These can both handle most lecture models without modification. However, 95% of students successfully use PyMC to complete our course at this point.\n",
    "\n",
    "## PyMC\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some history\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2003, Chris Fonnesbeck [started](https://www.pymc.io/blog/PyMC_Past_Present_Future.html) writing PyMC ({cite:t}`pymc_all_versions`) as a graduate student at the University of Georgiaâ€”partly out of frustration with WinBUGS. Eventually, PyMC3 became popular as a Python-based alternative to [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/). Both used implementations of the NUTS algorithm for sampling ({cite:t}`hoffman2011nouturn`). PyMC3 was based on Theano, a tensor library for doing machine learning-related math. In 2016, PyMC was sponsored by [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/uncategorized/numfocus-announces-new-fiscally-sponsored-project-pymc3), an organization started in part by the authors of NumPy, Matplotlib, and IPython and others to promote open scientific computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "I started converting the course examples to PyMC3 in 2022. Later that year, PyMC version 4.0 was [released](https://www.pymc.io/blog/v4_announcement.html). The backend switched to Aesara, a rewrite of Theano based on JAX. Towards the end of 2022, the PyMC devs forked Aesara to create [Pytensor](https://www.pymc.io/blog/pytensor_announcement.html) over some governance conflicts, and the current major version, PyMC v5, came out. \n",
    "\n",
    "There have been lots of changes and I've had to update the code examples a few times. In fact, there are still some that need to be updated that used to work in PyMC3 or v4. I'm going to copy the practice of using the [watermark extension](https://github.com/rasbt/watermark) as in the [PyMC Example Gallery](https://www.pymc.io/projects/examples/en/latest/gallery.html) to show the exact versions each example was last run on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "This site is currently using PyMC version 5. The installation instructions below are based on the ones at the [PyMC website](https://www.pymc.io/projects/docs/en/latest/installation.html). I'm going to go into more detail here, though.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "I highly recommend using Miniforge and Mamba to manage the PyMC environment. Students seem to have issues with Anaconda every semester. If you have Anaconda, Conda, or Mamba already, please make sure you only use the conda-forge channel as a source.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "For MacOS, make sure you have the Xcode command line tools installed with ```xcode-select --install``` in your terminal.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you don't have Conda already, install [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge?tab=readme-ov-file#install). The Windows instructions are [here](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge?tab=readme-ov-file#windows).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Confirm that you aren't using the [Anaconda default channels](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/troubleshooting.html#using-the-defaults-channels).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Install pymc to a new environment. If you're using miniforge you can leave off the ```-c conda-forge``` part, because it will use that channel by default. If you aren't using miniforge, definitely leave that in there and also replace ```mamba``` with ```conda```.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mamba create -c conda-forge -n your_pymc_env_name \"pymc>=5\"\n",
    "mamba activate your_pymc_env_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Optional**: Install these useful packages to your new environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "For using Jupyter Lab or Jupyter notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mamba install -c conda-forge jupyterlab ipywidgets \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For using nutpie, a much faster implementation of the NUTS sampling algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mamba install -c conda-forge numba nutpie \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've imported PyMC, if you're getting a warning on Windows about g++ not being available, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mamba install -c conda-forge m2w64-toolchain\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For new or specialized PyMC features, try the [PyMC Extras](https://pypi.org/project/pymc-extras/) package.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mamba install -c conda-forge pymc-extras\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "If your model is running very slowly or you're having other issues getting PyMC to work, there could be many causes. First, make sure you have followed the installation instructions above. Second, make sure you are actually using the newly created environment!"

    "- In the lecture examples, the professor often uses 100,000 or more samples. Don't do that in PyMC! The NUTS sampler, which is PyMC's default, can explore the posterior much more efficiently. Start with 1,000 or fewer when first testing out your model, then increase to a comfortable number."
